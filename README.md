Video Description: You've probably seen the sample 2D assets, 
watched the infinite runner presentation, and played around with the 2D tools in Unity. 
That's all well and good if you want to make side scrolling 2D games, 
but what about top-down 2D games? In this session we are going to look at making top-down 
style 2D games in Unity. We will examine the ways to build scenes, ways to control characters, 
and some of the more confusing elements of the top-down style (including things like attacking). 
"Stabbing" is the new "explosions".
